Assisted visual intillegence
The Augmented Visual Intelligence project is aimed at providing an easy-to-use web application to
visually impaired students, enabling them to access educational content, play games, take tests, and
perform other activities. The web app is designed to be navigated through a search bar or voice
commands, making it accessible to those who are visually challenged.
In today's world, the internet has become an essential source of information that should be accessible to
everyone, including those with visual impairments. With the help of technologies like speech recognition,
websites can be made easily accessible to visually impaired individuals. By providing audio input and
receiving speech output, these individuals can navigate the website with ease. This approach allows
visually impaired individuals to engage with websites using voice input and simplifies the process of
reading content and navigating between links through voice output, thereby addressing the accessibility
concerns of the visually impaired.
